You can use this code to measure both temperature and displacement.

The information on the sensors and MCU used in this project is as follows.

MCU: STM32F446RE
Thermocouple: Max31855K(K-type)(Sparkfun)
Stretch sensor: EC100-N-421-A01(Taiwan alpha)

The code consists of SPI communication for temperature measurement, and timer rising edge capture for length measurement.
